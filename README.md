# Trade and Commerce for the Traveller Roleplaying Game

The purpose of this program is to automate the trade and commerce process for
the Traveller Roleplaying Game.

This idea started many years ago, when I was reading the Trade and Commerce
section in the Referee's Guide for MegaTraveller.  I wanted to automate the
act of taking on passengers and mail, securing freight and even speculative
cargo to simulate the economic prospect of interstellar trade.  

My primary inspiration for doing this was C.J. Cherryh's outstanding book
Merchanter's Luck.  This book presented a unique look into the role of 
the Merchanter, carrying cargo to various stations in space. It was a 
unique view, significantly different from the standard soldier in space, or
the sweeping drama of powerful families.  It was about trying to stay 
solvent in a challenging environment.  The Traveller RPG provided the exact
method to experience this from a gaming standpoint.

Phase 1:  Barebones Execution
    You are required to be precise on entries.  There is no user interface, 
no entry validations, etc.  It is quick and dirty code designed to function
in a rudimentary way.

Phase 2:  Basic Execution
    This phase is identified by cleaning up the code, providing data entry
validation, and cleaning up entry and output.  

Phase 3:  Release Execution
    This phase is identified by the incorporation of a graphical user 
interface, star maps, etc.  This would be the type of program one 
could expect to pay for, if even for very little at all.  It would also
be identified by the software moving from development to maintenance.
